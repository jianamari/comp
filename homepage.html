            <h2>Why don't kids enjoy Maths</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class="paragraph_1">
            <p>Many teens find math challenging and frustrating for several reasons. 
                The subject often seems abstract and hard to relate to, making it tough to grasp for those who struggle with the basics. 
                Negative past experiences and a lack of confidence can also make math feel like a big hurdle. 
                Plus, the pressure to be quick and accurate in math class, along with limited connections to real-life situations, can make it seem more like a chore than an interesting skill to learn.</p>

            <h2>What can help students enjoy maths?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph_2">
            <p> To help students enjoy math, incorporating a variety of engaging strategies can make a significant difference. 
                Using real-life examples helps students see the practical applications of mathematical concepts, while hands-on activities and math games add an element of fun and interaction. 
                Integrating technology through videos, animations, and interactive tools can bring math to life and make complex ideas more accessible. 
                Connecting math to other subjects, such as science or art, can highlight its relevance and foster a deeper understanding. 
                Creative problem-solving activities encourage critical thinking, and personalizing lessons to fit individual learning styles ensures that each student remains engaged. Finally, celebrating achievements, both big and small, boosts motivation and reinforces a positive attitude towards math.

            <h2> Advantages of using online learning</h2>
        </div>   
        <div class="paragraph_3">
            <p>Online learning offers a multitude of advantages for students, fostering a deeper engagement with their studies and a more positive relationship with challenging subjects like mathematics. 
                By providing interactive and flexible resources, online platforms help students build confidence in their knowledge, which in turn enhances their motivation and promotes a better understanding of the material. 
                The diverse tools available encourage critical thinking and active participation, leading to improved retention of information over time. 
                This personalized approach not only supports a more thorough grasp of concepts but also helps students develop a more favorable attitude toward subjects they might otherwise find daunting.</p>

            <h2>Disadvantages of using online learning</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph_4">
            <p>Online learning, while offering many benefits, also presents several disadvantages that can impact students' mathematical education. 
                One significant drawback is that memorization strategies often used in online platforms may not translate well to real-world applications of math. 
                Additionally, online resources sometimes only skim the surface of mathematical topics, leading to a lack of in-depth understanding. 
                Over-reliance on technology can deter students from developing their own problem-solving skills and may cause distractions if game elements overshadow the core mathematical concepts. 
                Furthermore, math games might not address individual learning needs effectively, leaving some students without the additional support they require. 
                The emphasis on interactive tools can also result in insufficient practice with conventional techniques, which is problematic when students face standardized tests or real-world scenarios requiring traditional methods.</p></div>
